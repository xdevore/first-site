<p>User Problem: Many artists create albums to be listened to in one sitting. 
    However, with streaming services dominating the music listening market, 
    users do not have to purchase entire albums to listen to their favorite songs. 
    If there was a web application that could create rooms to allow a group of people
    to listen to an entire album all the way through at a scheduled time, listeners could have a
    definitive time to listen to an album and artists could make albums in which all the songs could
    fit together.

<p>Users: Music listeners who enjoy listening to entire albums all the way through, as well as artists who 
    want to make albums that their fans will listen to all the way through.
</p>

<p>Comparison: There is currently an app called "JQBX" that allows Spotify users to listen to music 
    together in an online room, but as far as I could find, there is no application that hosts online rooms
    playing one specific album at a scheduled time.
